**** [Foobar Grid View] ****

This is my custom foobar theme set-up.  It is aimed around browsing music by scrolling through a grid view of album covers.

****************************
Set-Up:

1. Download the latest version of foobar
2. Find your installed foobar folder, add the provided component dll files to your components.
(For a direct download of these components from the foobar website, visit the Documentation file).
3. Add Nadia815.fth inside the themes folder.
4. Start foobar.  File -> Preferences -> Display -> Default User Interface -> Import Theme -> Nadia815.fth
5. Enjoy.


****************************
Error Support:

If foobar complains that your components are damaged, then the provided components have probably become outdated.
Visit the Documentation file for a description of how to get the latest ones.

For any other concerns, feel free to contact me.
