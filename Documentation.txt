come with the installation plus these extras downloaded from the foobar website:

1. Facets 1.0 (foo_facets.dll) http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_facets

2. Lyrics Show Panel 3 (foo_uie_lyrics3.dll) http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_uie_lyrics3
	- This displays song lyrics, scrolling.

3. Audio Scrobbler (foo_audioscrobbler.dll) http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_audioscrobbler

Another great component, if you would like to experiment with your own layout, 
is Simplaylist (http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_simplaylist).
It allows you to display album art within your Playlist View.
